Realization of a home automation prototype, able to intelligently manage a rolling shutter system with anti-intrusion block.
The main reason behind the project is to provide to the owner a complete apparatus manageable remotely and, in addition to that, able to recognize some pre-defined external conditions for which has to act consciously in a predetermined way.
